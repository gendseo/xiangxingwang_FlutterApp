# xiangxingwang_FlutterApp

English | [中文说明](https://github.com/gendseo/xiangxingwang_FlutterApp/blob/master/README_zh.md)

xiangxingwang_App is built by the Flutter framework, App version (dev 0.0.1), next version (alpha 0.0.1), and so on.  
The application is divided into three phases: design, coding and testing.  
Other parts might be: the use and collection of plugins, project progress and some plans, and some mixed things.  
If the project progresses to 60%, I will post the backend of the app, using Google's GRPC framework.Used programming language is Go and part Python script.
